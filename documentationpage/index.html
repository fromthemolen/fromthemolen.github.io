            <p>
                Node (or more formally Node.js) is an open-source, cross-platform, runtime environment that allows developers to create all
                kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser
                context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS). As such, the environment omits browser-specific
                JavaScript APIs and adds support for more traditional OS APIs including HTTP and file system libraries. </p>
            <p>
                From a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Great performance! Node has been designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and
                    is a very good match for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).</li>
                <li>
                    Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages
                    when you're writing both browser and web server code.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a relatively new programming language and benefits from improvements in language design when
                    compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP, etc.) Many other new and popular
                    languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can also use CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Scala, LiveScript,
                    etc.
                </li>
                <li>The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundreds of thousands of reusable packages. It also has
                    best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.</li>
                <li>
                    It is portable, with versions running on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS.
                    Furthermore, it is well-supported by many web hosting providers, that often provide specific infrastructure
                    and documentation for hosting Node sites.</li>
                <li> It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to
                    help.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You can trivially create a simple web server to respond to any request using just the Node HTTP package, as shown
                below. In fact, this is so "trivial" that this tutorial will not tell you a suggested file name nor how to
                launch that file. ;-)</p>
            <p> This will create a server and listen for any kind of HTTP request on URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/; when one is
                received, it will send a plain-text response "Hello World".</p>
            <pre><code>
// Load HTTP module var http = require("http");
// Create HTTP server and listen on port 8000 for requests
                
http.createServer(function(request, response) {
    // Set the response HTTP header with HTTP status and Content type
    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'}
); 
                        
// Send the response body "Hello World"
response.end('Hello World\n'); }).listen(8000);
                    
// Print URL for accessing server
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/');
            
            </code></pre>
            <p>Other common web-development tasks are not directly supported by Node itself. If you want to add specific handling
                for different HTTP verbs (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), separately handle requests at different URL paths
                ("routes"), serve static files, or use templates to dynamically create the response, then you will need to
                write the code yourself, or you can avoid reinventing the wheel and use a web framework! Express is the most
                popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a number of other popular Node web frameworks.
                It provides mechanisms to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
                </li>
                <li> Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.</li>
                <li>
                    Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for
                    rendering the response.</li>
                <li> Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While Express itself is fairly minimalist, developers have created compatible middleware packages to address
                almost any web development problem. There are libraries to work with cookies, sessions, user logins, URL
                parameters, POST data, security headers, and many more. You can find a list of middleware packages maintained
                by the Express team at Express Middleware (along with a list of some popular 3rd party packages).</p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>Note: This flexibility is a double edged sword. There are middleware packages to address almost any problem
                    or requirement, but working out the right packages to use can sometimes be a challenge. There is also
                    no "right way" to structure an application, and many examples you might find on the Internet are not
                    optimal, or only show a small part of what you need to do in order to develop a web application.</p>

                Node was initially released, for Linux only, in 2009. The NPM package manager was released in 2010, and native Windows support
                was added in 2012. The current LTS release is Node v8.11.2 while the latest release is Node 10.1.0. This
                is a tiny snapshot of a rich history; delve into Wikipedia if you want to know more.</p>
            <p>
                Express was initially released in November 2010 and is currently on version 4.16 of the API. You can check out the changelog
                for information about changes in the current release, and GitHub for more detailed historical release notes.

        <section class="main-section" id="How_popular_is_Node/Express?">
            <header>How popular is Node/Express?</header>
            <p>
                The popularity of a web framework is important because it is an indicator of whether it will continue to be maintained, and
                what resources are likely to be available in terms of documentation, add-on libraries, and technical support.
            </p>
            <p> There isn't any readily-available and definitive measurement of the popularity of server-side frameworks (although
                sites like Hot Frameworks attempt to assess popularity using mechanisms like counting the number of GitHub
                projects and StackOverflow questions for each platform). A better question is whether Node and Express are
                "popular enough" to avoid the problems of unpopular platforms. Are they continuing to evolve? Can you get
                help if you need it? Is there an opportunity for you to get paid work if you learn Express?
            </p>
            <p> Based on the number of high profile companies that use Express, the number of people contributing to the codebase,
                and the number of people providing both free and paid for support, then yes, Express is a popular framework!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Is_Express_opinionated?">
            <header>Is Express opinionated?</header>
            <p>
                Web frameworks often refer to themselves as "opinionated" or "unopinionated".</p>
            <p> Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task. They often
                support rapid development in a particular domain (solving problems of a particular type) because the right
                way to do anything is usually well-understood and well-documented. However they can be less flexible at solving
                problems outside their main domain, and tend to offer fewer choices for what components and approaches they
                can use.</p>
            <p> Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together
                to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used. They make it easier for developers to use the
                most suitable tools to complete a particular task, albeit at the cost that you need to find those components
                yourself.
            </p>
            <p> Express is unopinionated. You can insert almost any compatible middleware you like into the request handling
                chain, in almost any order you like. You can structure the app in one file or multiple files, and using any
                directory structure. You may sometimes feel that you have too many choices!</p>

            <header>What does Express code look like?</header>
            <p>
                In a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP requests from the web browser (or other client). When
                a request is received the application works out what action is needed based on the URL pattern and possibly
                associated information contained in POST data or GET data. Depending on what is required it may then read
                or write information from a database or perform other tasks required to satisfy the request. The application
                will then return a response to the web browser, often dynamically creating an HTML page for the browser to
                display by inserting the retrieved data into placeholders in an HTML template.</p>
            <p>
                Express provides methods to specify what function is called for a particular HTTP verb (GET, POST, SET, etc.) and URL pattern
                ("Route"), and methods to specify what template ("view") engine is used, where template files are located,
                and what template to use to render a response. You can use Express middleware to add support for cookies,
                sessions, and users, getting POST/GET parameters, etc. You can use any database mechanism supported by Node
                (Express does not define any database-related behaviour).</p>
            <p> The following sections explain some of the common things you'll see when working with Express and Node code.</p>
            <p>
                <span>Helloworld Express</span>
                <p>
                    First lets consider the standard Express Hello World example (we discuss each part of this below, and in the following sections).</p>
                <div class="tip"><p>Tip: If you have Node and Express already installed (or if you install them as shown in the next article),
                    you can save this code in a text file called app.js and run it in a bash command prompt by calling: ./node
                    ./app.js</p></div>
                    <pre><code>
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function(req,res)
    {res.send('Hello World!'); 
}); 
app.listen(3000, function() 
    {console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!'); 
});
                </code></pre>
                
                <p> The first two lines require() (import) the express module and create an Express application. This object,
                    which is traditionally named app, has methods for routing HTTP requests, configuring middleware, rendering
                    HTML views, registering a template engine, and modifying application settings that control how the application
                    behaves (e.g. the environment mode, whether route definitions are case sensitive, etc.)
                </p>
                <p> The middle part of the code (the three lines starting with app.get) shows a route definition. The app.get()
                    method specifies a callback function that will be invoked whenever there is an HTTP GET request with
                    a path ('/') relative to the site root. The callback function takes a request and a response object as
                    arguments, and simply calls send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!"
                </p>
                <p> The final block starts up the server on port '3000' and prints a log comment to the console. With the server
                    running, you could go to localhost:3000 in your browser to see the example response returned.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <span>Importing and creating modules</span>
                    <p> A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function.
                        Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express
                        applications.
                    </p>
                    <p> The code below shows how we import a module by name, using the Express framework as an example. First
                        we invoke the require() function, specifying the name of the module as a string ('express'), and
                        calling the returned object to create an Express application. We can then access the properties and
                        functions of the application object.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
var express = require('express'); 
var app = express(); </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can also create your own modules that can be imported in the same way.</p>
                    <div class="tip"><p> Tip: You will want to create your own modules, because this allows you to organise your code into managable
                        parts — a monolithic single-file application is hard to understand and maintain. Using modules also
                        helps you manage your namespace, because only the variables you explicitly export are imported when
                        you use a module.</p></div>
                    <p>
                        To make objects available outside of a module you just need to assign them to the exports object. For example, the square.js
                        module below is a file that exports area() and perimeter() methods:</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
exports.area = function(width) { return width * width; };
exports.perimeter = function(width) { return 4 * width; };</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> We can import this module using require(), and then call the exported method(s) as shown:</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
var square = require('./square'); 
// Here we require() the name of the file without the (optional) .js file extension 

console.log('The area of a square with a width of 4 is ' + square.area(4));
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <div class="note">

                        <span> Using asynchronous APIs
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p> JavaScript code frequently uses asynchronous rather than synchronous APIs for operations that may take
                        some time to complete. A synchronous API is one in which each operation must complete before the
                        next operation can start. For example, the following log functions are synchronous, and will print
                        the text to the console in order (First, Second). console.log('First'); console.log('Second'); By
                        contrast, an asynchronous API is one in which the API will start an operation and immediately return
                        (before the operation is complete). Once the operation finishes, the API will use some mechanism
                        to perform additional operations. For example, the code below will print out "Second, First" because
                        even though setTimeout() method is called first, and returns immediately, the operation doesn't complete
                        for several seconds.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
setTimeout(function() { 
    console.log('First'); 
}, 3000); 
console.log('Second');</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> Using non-blocking asynchronous APIs is even more important on Node than in the browser, because Node
                        is a single threaded event-driven execution environment. "single threaded" means that all requests
                        to the server are run on the same thread (rather than being spawned off into separate processes).
                        This model is extremely efficient in terms of speed and server resources, but it does mean that if
                        any of your functions call synchronous methods that take a long time to complete, they will block
                        not just the current request, but every other request being handled by your web application.
                    </p>
                    <p> There are a number of ways for an asynchronous API to notify your application that it has completed.
                        The most common way is to register a callback function when you invoke the asynchronous API, that
                        will be called back when the operation completes. This is the approach used above. </p>
                        <div class="tip"><p>Tip: Using callbacks can be quite "messy" if you have a sequence of dependent asynchronous operations
                        that must be performed in order, because this results in multiple levels of nested callbacks. This
                        problem is commonly known as "callback hell". This problem can be reduced by good coding practices
                        (see http://callbackhell.com/), using a module like async, or even moving to ES6 features like Promises.

                    <div class="note">
                        <p>Note: A common convention for Node and Express is to use error-first callbacks. In this convention
                            the first value in your callback functions is an error value, while subsequent arguments contain
                            success data. There is a good explanation of why this approach is useful in this blog: The Node.js
                            Way - Understanding Error-First Callbacks (fredkschott.com).</p>

                            Creating route handlers</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> In our Hello World Express example (see above), we defined a (callback) route handler function for HTTP
                        GET requests to the site root ('/').</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
app.get('/', function(req, res) 
    {
        res.send('Hello World!');
    }); 
                            </code></pre> The callback function takes a request and a response object as arguments. In this case the method
                        simply calls send() on the response to return the string "Hello World!" There are a number of other
                        response methods for ending the request/response cycle, for example you could call res.json() to
                        send a JSON response or res.sendFile() to send a file.</p>
                        <div class="tip"><p> JavaScript tip: You can use any argument names you like in the callback functions; when the callback
                        is invoked the first argument will always be the request and the second will always be the response.
                        It makes sense to name them such that you can identify the object you're working with in the body
                        of the callback.</p></div>
                    <p> The Express application object also provides methods to define route handlers for all the other HTTP
                        verbs, which are mostly used in exactly the same way: post(), put(), delete(), options(), trace(),
                        copy(), lock(), mkcol(), move(), purge(), propfind(), proppatch(), unlock(), report(), mkactivity(),
                        checkout(), merge(), m-search(), notify(), subscribe(), unsubscribe(), patch(), search(), and connect().
                    </p>
                    <p> There is a special routing method, app.all(), which will be called in response to any HTTP method. This
                        is used for loading middleware functions at a particular path for all request methods. The following
                        example (from the Express documentation) shows a handler that will be executed for requests to /secret
                        irrespective of the HTTP verb used (provided it is supported by the http module).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
app.all('/secret', function(req, res, next) { 
    console.log('Accessing the secret section ...');
    next();
    // pass control to the next handler 
}); </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> Routes allow you to match particular patterns of characters in a URL, and extract some values from the
                        URL and pass them as parameters to the route handler (as attributes of the request object passed
                        as a parameter).</p>
                    <p> Often it is useful to group route handlers for a particular part of a site together and access them using
                        a common route-prefix (e.g. a site with a Wiki might have all wiki-related routes in one file and
                        have them accessed with a route prefix of /wiki/). In Express this is achieved by using the express.Router
                        object. For example, we can create our wiki route in a module named wiki.js, and then export the
                        Router object, as shown below:</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
// wiki.js - Wiki route module 
var express = require('express'); 
var router = express.Router(); 
//Home page route 
router.get('/', function(req, res) { 
    res.send('Wiki home page'); 
}); 
// About
page route router.get('/about', function(req, res) { 
    res.send('About this wiki'); 
}); 
module.exports = router; 
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>Note: Adding routes to the Router object is just like adding routes to the app object (as shown previously).</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        To use the router in our main app file we would then require() the route module (wiki.js), then call use() on the Express
                        application to add the Router to the middleware handling path. The two routes will then be accessible
                        from /wiki/ and /wiki/about/.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
var wiki = require('./wiki.js'); 
// ... app.use('/wiki', wiki); 
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>We'll show you a lot more about working with routes, and in particular about using the Router, later
                        on in the linked section Routes and controllers.</p>
                    <span>Using middleware</span>
                    <p> Middleware is used extensively in Express apps, for tasks from serving static files to error handling,
                        to compressing HTTP responses. Whereas route functions end the HTTP request-response cycle by returning
                        some response to the HTTP client, middleware functions typically perform some operation on the request
                        or response and then call the next function in the "stack", which might be more middleware or a route
                        handler. The order in which middleware is called is up to the app developer.</p>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>
                            Note: The middleware can perform any operation, execute any code, make changes to the request and response object, and it
                            can also end the request-response cycle. If it does not end the cycle then it must call next()
                            to pass control to the next middleware function (or the request will be left hanging). </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Most apps will use third-party middleware in order to simplify common web development tasks like working
                        with cookies, sessions, user authentication, accessing request POST and JSON data, logging, etc.
                        You can find a list of middleware packages maintained by the Express team (which also includes other
                        popular 3rd party packages). Other Express packages are available on the NPM package manager.</p>
                    <p>
                        To use third party middleware you first need to install it into your app using NPM. For example, to install the morgan HTTP
                        request logger middleware, you'd do this: </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
$ npm install morgan 
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> You could then call use() on the Express application object to add the middleware to the stack:
                        <pre><code>
var express = require('express'); 
var logger = require('morgan'); 
var app = express(); 
app.use(logger('dev'));
... 
                        </code></pre> </p>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>Note: Middleware and routing functions are called in the order that they are declared. For some middleware
                            the order is important (for example if session middleware depends on cookie middleware, then
                            the cookie handler must be added first). It is almost always the case that middleware is called
                            before setting routes, or your route handlers will not have access to functionality added by
                            your middleware.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p> You can write your own middleware functions, and you are likely to have to do so (if only to create error
                        handling code). The only difference between a middleware function and a route handler callback is
                        that middleware functions have a third argument next, which middleware functions are expected to
                        call if they are not that which completes the request cycle (when the middleware function is called,
                        this contains the next function that must be called).</p>
                    <p>
                        You can add a middleware function to the processing chain with either app.use() or app.add(), depending on whether you want
                        to apply the middleware to all responses or to responses with a particular HTTP verb (GET, POST,
                        etc). You specify routes the same in both cases, though the route is optional when calling app.use().
                    </p>
                    <p> The example below shows how you can add the middleware function using both methods, and with/without
                        a route.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
var express = require('express'); var app = express(); 
// An example middleware function 
var a_middleware_function = function(req, res, next) { 
    // ... perform some operations next(); 
    // Call next() so Express
will call the next middleware function in the chain. 
}
// Function added with use() for all routes and verbs 
app.use(a_middleware_function);

// Function added with use() for a specific route app.use('/someroute', a_middleware_function);

// A middleware function added for a specific HTTP verb and route app.get('/', a_middleware_function);
app.listen(3000);</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <div class="tip"> <p> JavaScript Tip: Above we declare the middleware function separately and then set it as the callback.
                        In our previous route handler function we declared the callback function when it was used. In JavaScript,
                        either approach is valid.</p></div>

                        <span>Serving static files</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> You can use the express.static middleware to serve static files, including your images, CSS and JavaScript
                        (static() is the only middleware function that is actually part of Express). For example, you would
                        use the line below to serve images, CSS files, and JavaScript files from a directory named 'public'
                        at the same level as where you call node:</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>app.use(express.static('public'));</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> Any files in the public directory are served by adding their filename (relative to the base "public"
                        directory) to the base URL. So for example:</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
http://localhost:3000/images/dog.jpg 
http://localhost:3000/css/style.css 
http://localhost:3000/js/app.js
http://localhost:3000/about.html</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>You can call static() multiple times to serve multiple directories. If a file cannot be found by one
                        middleware function then it will simply be passed on to the subsequent middleware (the order that
                        middleware is called is based on your declaration order).</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
app.use(express.static('public')); 
app.use(express.static('media'));
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also create a virtual prefix for your static URLs, rather than having the files added to the base URL. For example,
                        here we specify a mount path so that the files are loaded with the prefix "/media":</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
app.use('/media', express.static('public'));
                        </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> Now, you can load the files that are in the public directory from the /media path prefix.</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
http://localhost:3000/media/images/dog.jpg
http://localhost:3000/media/video/cat.mp4 
http://localhost:3000/media/cry.mp3
                    </code></pre>

                    <p>For more information, see Serving static files in Express.</p>
                    <p> Handling errors Errors are handled by one or more special middleware functions that have four arguments,
                        instead of the usual three: (err, req, res, next). For example:</p>
                    <pre><code>
app.use(function(err, req, res, next) { 
    console.error(err.stack); 
    res.status(500).send('Something broke!'); 
});
</code></pre>

                    <p> These can return any content required, but must be called after all other app.use() and routes calls
                        so that they are the last middleware in the request handling process!
                    </p>
                    <p> Express comes with a built-in error handler, which takes care of any remaining errors that might be encountered
                        in the app. This default error-handling middleware function is added at the end of the middleware
                        function stack. If you pass an error to next() and you do not handle it in an error handler, it will
                        be handled by the built-in error handler; the error will be written to the client with the stack

                        <span>Using databases
                        </span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Express apps can use any database mechanism supported by Node (Express itself doesn't define any specific
                        additional behaviour/requirements for database management). There are many options, including PostgreSQL,
                        MySQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.</p>
                    <p> In order to use these you have to first install the database driver using NPM. For example, to install
                        the driver for the popular NoSQL MongoDB you would use the command:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>$ npm install mongodb</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p> The database itself can be installed locally or on a cloud server. In your Express code you require the
                        driver, connect to the database, and then perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.
                        The example below (from the Express documentation) shows how you can find "mammal" records using
                        MongoDB. </p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
//this works with older versions of mongodb version ~ 2.2.33 
var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/animals', function(err, db) { 
    if (err) throw err;
    db.collection('mammals').find().toArray(function (err, result) { 
        if (err) throw err; 
        console.log(result);
    }); 
}); 
//for mongodb version 3.0 and up
let MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient; 
MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/animals', function(err, client){ 
    if(err) throw err;  
    let db = client.db('animals'); 
    db.collection('mammals').find().toArray(function(err, result){ if(err) throw err; 
        console.log(result); 
        client.close(); 
    }); 
}  </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>Another popular approach is to access your database indirectly, via an Object Relational Mapper ("ORM").
                        In this approach you define your data as "objects" or "models" and the ORM maps these through to
                        the underlying database format. This approach has the benefit that as a developer you can continue
                        to think in terms of JavaScript objects rather than database semantics, and that there is an obvious
                        place to perform validation and checking of incoming data. We'll talk more about databases in a later
                        article.

                        <span> Rendering data (views) </span>Template engines (referred to as "view engines" by Express) allow you
                        to specify the structure of an output document in a template, using placeholders for data that will
                        be filled in when a page is generated. Templates are often used to create HTML, but can also create
                        other types of documents. Express has support for a number of template engines, and there is a useful
                        comparison of the more popular engines here: Comparing JavaScript Templating Engines: Jade, Mustache,
                        Dust and More.</p>
                    <p> In your application settings code you set the template engine to use and the location where Express should
                        look for templates using the 'views' and 'view engines' settings, as shown below (you will also have
                        to install the package containing your template library too!)</p>
                    <p>
                        <pre><code>
var express = require('express'); 
var app = express(); 
// Set directory to contain the templates ('views') 

app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views')); 
// Set view engine to use, in this case 'some_template_engine_name' 
app.set('view engine', 'some_template_engine_name'); 
</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>The appearance of the template will depend on what engine you use. Assuming that you have a template
                        file named "index.
                        <template_extension>" that contains placeholders for data variables named 'title' and "message", you would call Response.render()
                            in a route handler function to create and send the HTML response: </p>
                    <pre><code>
app.get('/', function(req, res) { 
    res.render('index', { title: 'About dogs', message: 'Dogs rock!' }); 
}); </code></pre>
                    <p>For more information see Using template engines with Express (Express docs). </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>File structure</span>
                    </p>
                    <p> Express makes no assumptions in terms of structure or what components you use. Routes, views, static
                        files, and other application-specific logic can live in any number of files with any directory structure.
                        While it is perfectly possible to have the whole Express application in one file, typically it makes
                        sense to split your application into files based on function (e.g. account management, blogs, discussion
                        boards) and architectural problem domain (e.g. model, view or controller if you happen to be using
                        an MVC architecture).</p>
                    <p> In a later topic we'll use the Express Application Generator, which creates a modular app skeleton that
                        we can easily extend for creating web applications.

                You've completed the first step in your Express/Node journey! You should now understand Express and Node's main benefits,
                and roughly what the main parts of an Express app might look like (routes, middleware, error handling, and
                template code). You should also understand that with Express being an unopinionated framework, the way you
                pull these parts together and the libraries that you use are largely up to you! </p>
            <p>Of course Express is deliberately a very lightweight web application framework, so much of its benefit and potential
                comes from third party libraries and features. We'll look at those in more detail in the following articles.
                In our next article we're going to look at setting up a Node development environment, so that you can start
                seeing some Express code in action.</p>
